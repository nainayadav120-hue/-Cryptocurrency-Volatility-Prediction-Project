        "\"\"\"Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on decentralized blockchain technology. Unlike traditional financial markets, cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are highly sensitive to global news, investor sentiment, and trading behavior. Due to this nature, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility, which refers to rapid and unpredictable price changes.\n",
        "Volatility plays a crucial role in financial decision-making. High volatility can lead to high returns but also increases the risk of losses. Therefore, predicting volatility in advance can help traders, investors, and financial institutions manage risk effectively.\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) techniques are capable of analyzing large volumes of historical data and identifying complex patterns that are not easily visible through traditional statistical methods. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict cryptocurrency volatility using historical market data.\"\"\"\n",
